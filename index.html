The following variables are available to shell scripts

BUILD_NUMBER
    The current build number, such as "153"

    The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created in 1.597+, but a YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss timestamp for older builds
BUILD_DISPLAY_NAME
    The display name of the current build, which is something like "#153" by default.

BUILD_TAG
    String of "jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}". Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.
